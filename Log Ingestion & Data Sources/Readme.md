# Log Ingestion & Data Sources

This section explains **what logs were collected**, **how they were forwarded** to the Wazuh Manager, and **how ingestion was validated**.
It focuses on ingestion and normalization.

---

## üß© Overview  
Collected endpoint and network telemetry was standardized and routed to the Wazuh Manager for correlation and analyst review. 
Sources include Windows endpoint telemetry (Sysmon + Windows Event Logs) and Linux telemetry (Suricata, auditd, osquery).

## üñ•Ô∏è Agent Connectivity Validation

To ensure successful log ingestion from both Windows and Ubuntu endpoints, agent connectivity was verified
through the **Wazuh Dashboard ‚Üí Agents ‚Üí Status** module. Both systems appeared as **active and connected**,
confirming secure communication with the Wazuh Manager.

**Purpose:**  
‚úÖ Demonstrates multi-OS agent connectivity and successful deployment of both Windows and Linux endpoints.  
‚úÖ Confirms that both agents are properly registered and communicating with the Wazuh Manager.

## üåê Suricata (Network IDS) Ingestion  
**What:** `eve.json` alerts from Suricata ‚Äî network scans, suspicious connections, signature matches.  
**How:** Suricata writes `eve.json` locally; Wazuh Agent is configured with a `<localfile>` entry to collect and forward these JSON alerts to the Manager for correlation.  
**Validation:** View Suricata alert in Discover and confirm JSON fields are parsed correctly.

## üîó Threat Enrichment (VirusTotal integration)  
**What:** File hash reputation lookups to add context to file-related events.  
**How:** Wazuh Manager enrichment module queries VirusTotal (configured without exposing keys in screenshots) and attaches a reputation score to relevant events.  
**Validation:** Shows an example enrichment result.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Ingestion Health & Normalization  
**What to show:** Demonstrated that logs are decoded/normalized (fields extracted) and visible in Discover.  
**How validated:** Used Wazuh Discover to inspect fielded events (source, timestamp, hostname, event_type) and confirm decoders are applied.  
**Why it matters:** Normalized fields enable rule correlation and meaningful analyst investigation later.

## üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated (summary)  
- Multi-source ingestion: Windows (Sysmon/WinEvents) + Linux (auditd/osquery) + IDS (Suricata).  
- Forwarding pipeline: Agent ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí Discover / Dashboard.  
- Normalization: Decoders applied so events are fielded and searchable.  
- Enrichment: VirusTotal used for contextualizing file events.
