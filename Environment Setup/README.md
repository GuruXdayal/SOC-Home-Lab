## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

This section outlines the technical setup and configuration process for the SOC Home Lab built using **Wazuh** and **Suricata** for endpoint and network monitoring.  
The focus is on demonstrating **structured implementation, environment design, and validation**.

## üß± 2. Virtual Machine Configurations
Each virtual machine served a specific purpose in the SOC architecture, simulating the attacker, detection, and monitoring components.

| VM Name                                       | Purpose                                | Memory | Disk  | Network Mode |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Ubuntu (Wazuh Manager)**                    | Centralized SIEM & log analysis        | 8 GB   | 80 GB | NAT          |
| **Windows Victim (Agent + Sysmon)**           | Endpoint telemetry & event collection  | 5 GB   | 50 GB | NAT          |
| **Ubuntu Victim (Suricata, auditd, osquery)** | Network IDS & Linux endpoint telemetry | 6 GB   | 50 GB | NAT          |
| **Kali Attacker**                             | Attack simulation & testing            | 3.5 GB | 60 GB | NAT          |

## üåê 3. Network Topology & Design
The SOC environment was designed as an **isolated NAT network**, enabling controlled communication between systems while maintaining Internet access for updates.

- **Wazuh Manager:** 192.168.137.10  
- **Windows Victim:** 192.168.137.11  
- **Ubuntu Victim:** 192.168.137.12  
- **Kali Attacker:** 192.168.137.13  

üìà *Key Design Highlights:*
- NAT Network for Internet connectivity (tool updates, integrations)  
- Internal SOC traffic isolation for analysis  
- Static IP assignments for predictable communication  
- Validated routing and gateway consistency

## üß© 4. Step-by-Step Installation Process
All installations were performed manually following **official documentation** for Wazuh, Suricata, and supporting tools.  
LLM-based tools like **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot** were used to refine configuration commands, troubleshoot issues, and accelerate workflow.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 5. Software Installation & Configuration
Configured and integrated the following key components:
- **Wazuh Manager** for centralized log analysis and alerting  
- **Wazuh Agents** on Windows and Ubuntu endpoints  
- **Sysmon** on Windows for advanced event telemetry  
- **Suricata** for real-time network intrusion detection  
- **auditd** and **osquery** for Linux host monitoring

## üåê 6. Network Connectivity Validation
Verified inter-VM communication and manager-agent connectivity using:
- ICMP ping tests  
- Wazuh agent registration checks  
- Suricata log forwarding validation

## ‚úÖ 7. Pre-requisites Checklist
Before deployment, the following baseline checks were completed:
- Virtualization enabled in BIOS  
- Sufficient resource allocation for smooth parallel execution  
- Proper network configuration in VMware  
- Connectivity between all VMs validated

## üöÄ 8. Deployment Order & Dependencies
The deployment followed a **bottom-up architecture** to ensure dependency alignment:

1. **Host Machine Optimization**
2. **Wazuh Manager Installation**
3. **Ubuntu Victim Configuration** (Suricata, auditd, osquery)
4. **Windows Victim Setup** (Sysmon, Agent)
5. **Kali Attacker Setup** (Attack simulation)
6. **Connectivity & Detection Validation**
