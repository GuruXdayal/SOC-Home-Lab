## 🧩 Project Summary

**SOC Home Lab** replicates an enterprise-grade blue-team environment within a virtualized setup.  
It demonstrates my ability to:
- Design and configure a detection-centric SOC architecture.  
- Ingest, normalize, and correlate multi-source logs.  
- Develop and validate custom detection rules (Wazuh + Suricata).  
- Simulate attack scenarios and visualize detections via dashboards.  
- Integrate external intelligence and AI-assisted workflows.

This project bridges the gap between **security theory and practical SOC operations**, showcasing real-world exposure and technical hands-on skills expected from a **SOC Level-1 Analyst**.
