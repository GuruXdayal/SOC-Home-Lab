## ðŸ§© Conclusion & Next Steps

This SOC Lab project marked a major milestone in my cybersecurity learning journey â€” bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world detection workflows. By building and managing an end-to-end **Security Operations Center (SOC) lab environment**, I gained hands-on experience across multiple core areas of blue team operations.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Highlights
- **Implemented multi-OS log ingestion pipeline** with Windows and Ubuntu agents sending real-time telemetry to Wazuh Manager.  
- **Simulated realistic attack scenarios** such as file tampering (FIM), network reconnaissance (Nmap), malware download detection, and SSH brute-force attempts â€” each successfully mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK tactics**.  
- **Engineered custom detection rules** in Wazuh to identify network-based Suricata alerts and user authentication anomalies via auditd logs.  
- **Integrated external intelligence via VirusTotal API** to enrich detections with real-time threat context.  
- **Correlated and visualized alerts** across multiple Wazuh modules including Threat Hunting, File Integrity Monitoring, and Malware Detection.  

This project not only enhanced my technical depth in **log analysis, alert correlation, and rule tuning**, but also strengthened my problem-solving mindset. I learned to troubleshoot complex issues, design effective detection logic, and leverage automation tools to streamline workflows.  

### ðŸš€ Next Steps
Building on this foundation, my next goal is to:
- Develop **advanced SOC automation workflows** using tools like **n8n** for log enrichment, threat intel correlation, and alert triaging.  
- Continue exploring **AI-driven integrations** in SOC environments to automate event analysis and improve incident response efficiency.  
- Expand the lab to include **cloud-based data sources and SIEM integrations** to simulate enterprise-grade SOC operations.  
- Prepare for **SOC L1 Analyst roles**, applying the knowledge of detection engineering, network monitoring, and automation gained from this project.  

### ðŸ’¡ Personal Reflection
This hands-on SOC project has been transformative â€” it taught me how each log, rule, and alert connects in the broader detection landscape. More importantly, it built the confidence to move beyond just tool usage, toward **understanding security architecture as a complete system**.  
The experience has laid a strong foundation not only for **SOC L1 readiness**, but also for my long-term goal of merging **AI and Security** to create smarter, automated, and adaptive defense workflows.
